Introduction <br/>
Explore my 3D portfolio! I used Blender for cool 3D designs and GSAP for smooth web animations. Enjoy a captivating experience as my creations come to life on your screen! <br/>

Scrolling down will help you to navigate through my portfolio. I used GSAP for smooth scrolling effect and canvas for changing the frames according to scroll. <br/>

I used blender and after creating the animation i took all the frames and are stored in blender repository.
